        <h1> About Us</h1><br><br>
        There are children in India who were born to some parents but are now left alone to fend for themselves. <br> These children are either thrown in a dumpster or left to survive in the orphanage, with no idea where to earn their bread and butter. <br>It would be natural to think for such children and take affirmative action in some form.

        While there are several means to support them <br> one of the most trusted ways is to get associated with an NGO.<br> Your donation for orphans through an NGO will ensure that the children are not shunted out to brave the streets without any help or support.
